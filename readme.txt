Let clients test simple style changes on the front end, to help make final decisions.

== Description ==
The Style Switcher plugin allows developers to offer clients a set of options for quickly swapping out and viewing different style options, from the front-end WordPress UI. Clients don\'t need to know anything about css or even WordPress admin options.

For example, if you would like to test a few different color options for headers, the plugin will allow you to set appropriate options, and the client can toggle between them, seeing changes live on the page.

== Installation ==
From your WordPress dashboard

1. **Visit** Plugins > Add New
2. **Search** for \"Style Switcher\"
3. **Activate** Style Switcher from your Plugins page
4. **Click** on the new Settings submenu item \"Style Switcher Settings\" and start creating settings!
